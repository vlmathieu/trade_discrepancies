Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
resources/raw_data/uncomtrade_data.parquet.gzip (missing locally, parent dir contents: .DS_Store, uncomtrade_4401.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_8703.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4407.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_merged.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4412.parquet.gzip, correspondence_FAO_HS.json, uncomtrade_4410.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4411.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4403.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4802.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4804.parquet.gzip, uncomtrade_4408.parquet.gzip)
